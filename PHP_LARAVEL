STEPS TO CONFIGURE PHP LARAVEL ON AWS EC2

Pre-requisites:
1.Amazon Linux AMI_1 Launched
2.RDS Mysql instance Launched

STEP 1:
Configure RDS MySQL Instance:
1.Create a Database with following details

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=***********
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=mysqldb2020
DB_USERNAME=mysqldb2020
DB_PASSWORD=mysqldb2020

STEP 2:
1.Launch Amazon Linux _1 instance.
2.SSH to Instance, install and configure as follows:
Login as root user
sudo su –
Install HTTP
yum install httpd24 -y

Install PHP 7.2

yum install php72 php72-mysqlnd php72-imap php72-pecl-memcache php72-pecl-apcu php72-gd php72-mbstring -y
yum install mod24_ssl -y

Now Start httpd service

service httpd start

Go to your browser of choice and paste the Public IP address of the EC2 instance.

 

Now that Apache server is running, we can proceed to install our Laravel Web App, but first, we need to make sure that in the event our instance is restarted, for whatever reason, that Apache will be automatically started as soon as the instance comes on. That way we wouldn’t have to ssh into the instance then starting it on the console each time. We will do this by running:
chkconfig —add httpd
chkconfig httpd on

Install git on our instance:
yum install git -y
Navigate to the Apache public folder:
cd /var/www/html
Now clone your project in these directory. Sample project is clone in the following directory.
git clone https://github.com/laravel/laravel.git

Now that we’ve cloned a fresh Laravel project, we need to reconfigure our Apache server to point to the Laravel directory. we will do this by copying the code below to the bottom of the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file:

Alias / /var/www/html/laravel/public/
<Directory "/var/www/html/laravel/public">
AllowOverride All
Order allow,deny
allow from all
</Directory>

Edit the .htaccess file:
nano /var/www/html/laravel/public/.htaccess
Then add RewriteBase / just below RewriteEngine On
Run the command

cd /var/www/html/laravel
mv .env.example .env
nano .env
Paste in the code below. Make sure you substitute the DB_HOST parameter value for your generated MySQL endpoint

APP_NAME=Laravel
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

LOG_CHANNEL=stack

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=<RDS ENDPOINT>
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravelaws
DB_USERNAME=laravelaws
DB_PASSWORD=laravelaws

BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
CACHE_DRIVER=file
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
SESSION_DRIVER=database
SESSION_LIFETIME=120

Once done, press ^X, then enter y to the prompted question and hit enter.
Now we need to give Apache write access to the storage folder, else Laravel will throw a write permission error.

sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html/laravel/storage

Let’s restart Apache to ensure immediate effect, and then return to the laravel folder:

service httpd restart
cd /var/www/html/Laravel

To install composer(make sure you’re in the laravel directory):
yum install wget -y
wget https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar

Confirm installation by running:
php composer.phar
Now that we have composer installed, we will now install all needed Laravel packages specified in the composer.json file:
php composer.phar install
Generate Application key:
php artisan key:generate
Create Authentication scaffold:
php artisan make:auth
User session will be stored on the database instead of the file on the Ec2 instance. This is because, when we eventually scale our Laravel Web App, the Load Balancer will balance traffic request across all instances. So if my session file was stored on instance 1 and my next request is directed to instance 5, instance 5 will not have access to my session file on instance 1, thus it will ask that i re-authenticate myself. To avoid this, we will manage user sessions on the database, since all instances are connected and have access to it.

Create a sessions table migration:
php artisan session:table
Now let’s run Laravel migrations:
php artisan migrate

Paste the Public IP of your instance in your browser. You should see the Laravel welcome screen:
